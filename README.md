# CNN
Massive progress has been made in the field of artificial intelligence, closing the gap between human and computer capacities. Proponents and experts alike work tirelessly on many facets of the topic to achieve remarkable results. Computer vision is just one example of such a field.
The goal of this area of study is to teach computers to see and understand the world as humans do, so that they can apply this understanding to fields as diverse as image and video recognition, image analysis and classification, media recreation, recommendation systems, natural language processing, and so on. Over the course of its development and refinement, a Convolutional Neural Network has been at the centre of most of the progress made in Computer Vision using Deep Learning.

Email me if you want me to send you database.
Just run this step by step like in colab-notebook or Jupyter Notebook, it'll be running perfect. Don't worry.
If you have come this far, I appreciate it.
